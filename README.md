## OOJS

### Question #1

What are constructor functions and the `new` keyword? What is a prototype? Describe an example of when we would use a constructor function versus a prototype.

Your Answer:
```
Constructor functions is used in OOP to make an object type. You can create one object and use the new keyword to add  multiple objects of this one "type". The function name starts w a capital letter.

The new keyword is used in the constructor function to tell Javascript that you are calling the constructor function and it will automatically  create a new empty object and return the object.

An example is:
function Band() {
  this.name = "";
  this.genre = "";
}

var chrvches = new Band("chrvches")

chrvches.name  would return chrvches
-----
prototypes are similar to constructor functions and actually use constructors but it does not duplicate the data. All Javascript objects have a prototype and points to another object. It inherits the property from the Javascript object. However you are able to add properties using prototypes.
example:
Band.prototype.albums = "Every Open Eye";


I would use a constructor function when


versus in this instance where I would use a prototype instead:

### Question #2

Define a Javascript constructor called 'Instructor'. Every instance of Instructor should have a `name` property, and a method called `givesHomework`. This method takes one argument called `assignment` and, when executed, console-logs "[name] gives the students [assignment] for Friday's homework."

Instantiate an instructor named 'Robin' and call its `givesHomework` method with "Intro to Ruby" as the argument.

Your Answer:

```js
function Instructor(name){
  this.name = "";
  givesHomework = ""
  

}

```
### Question #3

Given the following front-end JS model, add an instance method for all pandas called `eat_bamboo`. Calling this method should increase that panda's value for `num_bamboo_eaten` by 1.

```js

var Panda = function(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.num_bamboo_eaten = 0;
}
```

## jQuery

### Question #5

Which of the following statements will work, assuming jQuery is loaded?

Select all that apply:
```
[] `$(".post").css("background", "peachpuff")`

[] `$(".post").html()`
[] `document.querySelectorAll(".post")[0].innerHTML`
[] `document.querySelectorAll(".post").innerHTML`
```

### Question #6

Using jQuery, add an event listener for clicks on the button with the id
`greeting`. When the event happens, the code should append a paragraph to the
body that says "hello".

Your Answer:
```js
// your code here
```

### Question #7

Define a function called `doSomething`. It should take one argument, called
`thingToDo`. When called, `doSomething` should invoke the `thingToDo` function. Demonstrate calling `doSomething` while passing in an argument.

Your Answer:
```js
// write code here
```

### Question #8

Once in Vanilla JS, and once in jQuery, write a function that adds an event listener for when a button with a class of "submit-quiz" is clicked. The event alerts a user "Great Job on Quiz 4!".

Your Answer:
```js
// write code here
```
